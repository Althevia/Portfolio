  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Intro to Robotics</h1>
  <h3 style="text-align:center;">June 26th, 2017</h3>
  <p style="padding-left:20px";>My ideas of robotics has changed from something that requires extensive knowledge of physics to sometihng that even an ordinary person can dabble in.</p>
  <p style="padding-left:20px";>I'm excited about robots being able to help save lives with their precision, but I am nervous that these same robots will become self-aware and kill off the human race someday.</p>
  <p style="padding-left:20px";>I worked on circuits in groups and what worked well was having more minds to help solve problems.  What could've worked better was more communication on what exactly people were making so we could spread our ideas.</p>
