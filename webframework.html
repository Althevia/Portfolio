  <h4 style="padding-left:20px";>What is the MVC paradigm?  How is it used?</h4>
  <p style="padding-left:20px";>The MVC paradigm is a pattern that connects the user to how the program runs behind the scenes.  The three main components of it are model, view, and controller.  The controller takes inputs from the user and converts it to commands for the model.  The model then manages these commands and alters the view, which the user sees.</p>
  <h4 style="padding-left:20px";>What is the difference between a framework and a library?</h4>
  <p style="padding-left:20px";>The framework contains numerous libraries and calls upon them to create basic templates for the user to use.</p>
  <h4 style="padding-left:20px";>Why might you use a framework instead of creating an app yourself?</h4>
  <p style="padding-left:20px";>You might use a framework instead because a framework is premade while creating an app would take more time.  Being premade, using the framework is much more efficient.</p>
